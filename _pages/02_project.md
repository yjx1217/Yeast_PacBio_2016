# Abstract
Structural rearrangements have long been recognized as an important source of genetic variation with implications in phenotypic diversity and disease, yet their evolutionary dynamics are difficult to characterize with short-read sequencing. Here, we report long-read sequencing for 12 strains representing major subpopulations of the partially domesticated yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and its closest wild relative *Saccharomyces paradoxus*. The complete genome assemblies and annotation allow for explicit chromosomal partitioning of cores, subtelomeres and chromosome-ends and a high-resolution view of structural dynamics across all partitions. In chromosomal cores, *S. paradoxus* exhibits higher accumulation rate of balanced structural rearrangements (inversions, translocations and transpositions) whereas *S. cerevisiae* accumulates unbalanced rearrangements (large insertions, deletions and duplications) more rapidly during their respective diversifications. In subtelomeres, recurrent interchromosomal reshuffling was found in both species, with higher rate in *S. cerevisiae*. Such striking contrasts between wild and domesticated yeasts highlight the influence of human activities on structural genome evolution.
