# Abstract
Structural rearrangements have long been recognized as an important source of genetic variation with implications in phenotypic diversity and disease, yet our understanding of their evolutionary dynamics and functional consequences remains limited. Here, we performed the first population-level PacBio genome sequencing for 12 strains representing major subpopulations of two closely related *Saccharomyces* yeast species: *S. cerevisiae* and its wild relative *S. paradoxus*. Both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of these strains were assembled with unprecedented continuity and accuracy. The thorough comparison of these complete genomes in a well-defined phylogenetic framework revealed a high-resolution landscape and dynamics of structural rearrangements in the genome evolution of these two species. Although diversified much more recently, *S. cerevisiae* strains exhibit similar amount of unbalanced structural rearrangements in their core nuclear chromosomes and more rapid ectopic reshuffling in their subtelomeres compared to S. paradoxus strains, a pattern probably linked to their recent interaction with human activities.

# Impact Statement
