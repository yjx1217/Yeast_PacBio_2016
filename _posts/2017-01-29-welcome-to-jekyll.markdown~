We set up this website to provide general description and data release for the Yeast PacBio Sequencing project. In this project, we sequenced 12 strains representing major subpopulations of two close-related *Saccharomyces* yeast species: *S. cerevisiae* and *S. paradoxus*. We feel the high-quality genome assemblies and annotations that we generated in this study will be of great interests to the yeast community. We want to share this valuable dataset to the community to facilitate future genomic and functional investigations on this important model organisms.

Please note that we made minor updates for both the assemblies and annotations today. If you download our data files before today, please use the new data to replace the old ones for your analysis.
