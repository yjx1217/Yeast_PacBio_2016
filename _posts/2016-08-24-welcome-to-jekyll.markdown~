We are about to submit our manuscript on this project soon. Therefore we set up this website to provide general description and data release for this project. We feel the high-quality genome assemblies and annotations that we generated for this study will be of great interests to the yeast community. We want to share this valuable dataset for the community to facilitate future genomic and functional studies on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and its wild relative *Saccharomyces paradoxus*.
